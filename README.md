This repository contains a collection of programming laboratory works written in the C language, completed as part of the coursework at BSUIR. The labs cover a wide range of fundamental topics necessary for mastering structured programming and gaining practical skills in C development.

The topics include sorting algorithms, working with binary and text files, implementing classic data structures such as stacks and queues, and building and manipulating binary trees. Each lab focuses on specific aspects of programming, such as input/output operations, memory management, file processing, and algorithm implementation.

All programs are written in C and compiled using the gcc compiler. Each lab folder includes source files, task descriptions, and input/output examples where necessary. The code is structured and commented to be easy to understand and suitable for both beginners and students looking to reinforce their knowledge.

The repository is intended for educational use and aims to provide a solid foundation for more advanced programming disciplines
